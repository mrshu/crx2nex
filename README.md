A tool for converting the Chrome browser extensions into new Opera extensions

What?
-----

It's been a while since Opera has had decided that WebKit is just superior to anything they have and thus started to use it in their browser. This affected many things among which were extensions. Many things had changed, most notably the file extension (.nex). From functional point of view Opera extensions started to resemble Chrome ones more and more.

This project is an experiment which tries to answer the question "How hard is it to convert a Chrome extension into an Opera one?".
